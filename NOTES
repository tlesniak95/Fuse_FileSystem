## FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)

Overview: FUSE allows for custom file system development in user space, facilitating the creation of file systems without modifying kernel code.

Functionality: FUSE redirects all system calls related to the file system to the user space, which is where our implementation resides.

Key Function: fuse_main(), which is essential for initializing and running the FUSE file system.

Structure: fuse_operations struct, crucial for defining callback functions for various system calls.


# Development Steps

mkfs.wfs: Initialize the filesystem, writing the superblock.
FUSE Integration: Then, focus on integrating with FUSE.
Argument Parsing: In mount.wfs, process command-line arguments before calling fuse_main.
Callback Functions: Implement necessary FUSE callback functions, starting with getattr.

# Virtual File System (VFS) Interaction

Role: VFS acts as an abstraction layer in the Linux kernel, providing a common interface for various file systems.

Interaction: VFS interacts with both traditional file systems (like ext3, ext4, xfs) and user-space file systems via FUSE.

# Disk File
Purpose: Simulates a block device, storing all data and metadata for the file system.

# System Calls and Debugging
Tool: # strace # can be used to identify which system calls are invoked, aiding in debugging.

Debugging: Hex viewers like xxd are instrumental in examining the raw contents of the disk file for debugging purposes.

# Log-Structured File System
Definition: Updates are written sequentially, which can improve speed and reduce wear on certain storage media.
Implication: Since itâ€™s log-structured, we never modify data in place; all updates are APPEND ONLY

# Superblock
Contains:
    Magic number - tells program how to interpret the file
    Head - pointer that points to the end

Following the Superblock are the log entries.

.

# Memory Allocation for wfs_log_entry
Caution: Care must be taken when allocating memory; use the size from the wfs_inode_ structure for accuracy. 
### DO NOT USE sizeof(wfs_inode_t)!

# File and Directory Representation
Uniformity: Both files and directories are represented as log entries, each with specific metadata and structure.

# File System Initialization
Script: ./create_disk.sh is used for initializing the disk file.
mkfs.wfs: A utility to write the superblock and potentially initial structures like an empty root directory.

# Mounting the Filesystem
Command: ./mount.wfs -f -s disk mnt mounts the file system.
-f for foreground (requires a second terminal).
-s for single-threaded operation.

# Callback Functions
Implementation: Essential to implement callback functions in fuse_operations for file operations like getattr, read, write, etc.

# Interacting with the Disk File
Methods: Can use read/write or mmap; the latter treats the file system as an array but requires careful memory and synchronization management.

# Filesystem Cleaning (Extra Credit)
Concept: Involves reclaiming space from obsolete log entries, a complex but beneficial optimization for log-structured file systems.

# .mkfs and Superblock

First Task: Writing mkfs.wfs to initialize the filesystem.
Superblock: Writes the superblock and potentially the first log entry.
Size Consideration: Superblock is 8 bytes. The initial log entry is the size of an inode (as it represents an empty directory).

# Mounting the Filesystem

Command: ./mount.wfs -f -s disk mnt
-f runs the filesystem in the foreground (requires a second terminal).
-s for single-threaded operation.
Code Focus: Most of the coding effort will be in mount.wfs.

# Log-Structured Design

Modification Approach: Due to the log-structured nature, modifications are appended as log entries, ensuring the original data is not altered.

# Debugging Techniques

Hex Viewer: Utilize tools like xxd for inspecting the superblock and other file system structures.

# Commands for Inspection:

$ ./create_disk.sh to initialize the disk.
$ xxd -e -g 4 disk | less 
$ ./mkfs.wfs disk
$ xxd -e -g 4 disk | less

to view the disk contents before and after running mkfs.wfs.



# File System Entries

Size Calculation: Each entry size is the sum of the inode size (11 integers) and the data size.

# Disk File Interaction

File Operations: Use standard file operations like open and lseek to interact with the disk file representing the filesystem.
